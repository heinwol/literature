  abstract = {In the first part, we study amalgams of relatively hyperbolic groups and also therelatively quasiconvex subgroups of such amalgams. We prove relative hyperbolicityfor a group that splits as a finite graph of relatively hyperbolic groups with parabolicedge groups; this generalizes a result proved independently by Dahmani, Osin andAlibegovic. More generally, we prove a combination theorem for a group that splitsas a finite graph of relatively hyperbolic groups with total, almost malnormal andrelative quasiconvex edge groups. Moreover, we provide a criterion for detectingquasiconvexity of subgroups in relatively hyperbolic groups that split as above. As anapplication, we show local relative quasiconvexity of any f.g. group that is hyperbolicrelative to Noetherian subgroups and has a small-hierarchy. Studying free subgroupsof relatively hyperbolic groups, we reprove the existence of a malnormal, relativelyquasiconvex, rank 2 free subgroup F in a non-elementary relatively hyperbolic groupG. Using this result and with the aid of a variation on a result of Arzhantseva, weshow that if G is also torsion-free then "generically" any subgroup of F is aparabolic,malnormal in G and quasiconvex relative to P and therefore hyperbolically embedded.As an application, generalizing a result of I. Kapovich, we prove that for any f.g.,non-elementary, torsion-free group G that is hyperbolic relative to P, there exists agroup G‚àó containing G such that G‚àó is hyperbolic relative to P and G is not relativelyquasiconvex in G‚àó .In the second part, we investigate the existence of F2 √ó F2 in the non-metric small-cancellation groups. We show that a C(6)-T(3) small-cancellation group cannotcontain a subgroup isomorphic to F2 √ó F2 . The analogous result is also proven in theC(3)-T(6) case.},

In the beginning, the basics of public key cryptography is discussed for the reason that this is the basic idea used in contemporary cryptography. After introducing the fundamental algorithms of cryptography, we mention the analogs in non-commutative algebraic cryptography. Using decision and search problems in Group theory as basis key agreement protocols introduced. Next attacks on groupbased systems are discussed. While, choosing the platform group and the group problem is the key for the security of the system, a secret sharing scheme is introduced in behalf of the writer. Cayley Hash functions and attacks in such systems is introduced next, closing the survey with random strings in group theory and the generalization of some classical problems to the non-commutative case.},

In this paper, we describe a cryptosystem whose security is based on the computational hardness of the subgroup membership (search) problem: given a group G, a subgroup H generated by h1, . . . , h k , and an element h ‚àà H, find an expression of h in terms of h 1 , . . . , h k . It is also interesting to note that groups which we suggest to use as the platform, free metabelian groups, are infinitely presented, in contrast with groups typically used in public key cryptography. Nevertheless, these group have efficiently (and, in fact, very easily) solvable word problem.},
